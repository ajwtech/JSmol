developers:

The starting point for building this project is buildfromjmol.xml. 
See the detailed notes there.

Please make commit comments in Jmol/src/viewer/Jmol.properties

You may have to right-click on buildtojs.xml and set its 
external configuration to:

-- refresh resources upon completion (project...)
-- build project before starting

Also, you should turn off project -- build Automatically, because it
seems to slow things down.
