INSTALLING JAVA2SCRIPT

At this point in time, you will need either Eclipse 4.2 or 4.3 
for the Java2Script compiler to work. The plug-in can be found in 
j2s/eclipse_plugin.

http://dev.zhourenjian.com/j2s/j2s-2.0.0-20131003-eclipse-4.3.zip

Within each of those zip files remove net.sf.j2s.core_2.0.0.jar
and place it in your eclipse/plugins/ directory.
